# FUNCTIONALITIES
## How may I help you, lazy developer friend ?
1) Go to the main videos page in user/channel you provided.
2) Get all videos' URLs. 
3) Get all playlists' URLs. 
4) Scrape all playlists infos from their URLs obtained in 3) : title + the URLs of videos it contains.
5) Scrape all videos infos from their URLs obtained in 2) : title + basic infos + description + inspects in which playlist(s) the video appears.
6) At this point, all videos infos are written in Notion. Checkbox "downloaded" is off for every video.
7) Downloads all videos one by one and mark them as downloaded in Notion when completed. 
- I update by myself : if a new video is published, it will appear on all videos section, and thus be automatically added in Notion and downloaded.
- I can continue where I stopped, but —> !!! Maybe you will have to manually delete the last video info that might have been only partially recorded !!!
- For each playlist / all videos section, I scroll down until the playlist's end is reached so that all URLs are present.
- When Firefox is launched with Selenium, AdGuard (or AdBlock, don't remember exactly) is automatically installed as an extension to avoid download errors with PyTube if there is an ad.

# SETUP
## Dependancies
- `selenium` webdriver with `gecko` driver (firefox, not chrome)
- `pytube` (pip package for downloading YouTube video from URL)

## Quick fices for common issues
- If `pytube` gets you a `SSL Certificate` error, and you're on macOS, launch `Install Certificates.command` in `Applications/Python3.x/`

# PROGRESS
### To-do
- fix problem with method `attemptStreamDownload()` / error with `vid.download(cst.path_downloads)` —> put priority order for bitrates —> if it still fails, it means that no mp4 format is available —> CRY.
- download videos directly in a folder named like user/channel name
- detect video length asap (ideally, in all videos section) —> possibility to ignore videos above a certain length
- manage direct videos : 'Diffusé en direct le 30 nov. 2017'
- auto-detect which part of the raw title contains video number, if any
- prevent video loading from stalling when window is not visible/active
- force English with Selenium but only for channels spoken in English

### Done
- try to split video raw title into title and video number 
- make tests with slugifier to make `in_playlists` correspond to `In playlists`
- inspect all playlists and record matches in existing Notion rows
- fix problem with dates somewhere (july truncated in jui like juin)
- recode the handler looper by calling itself recursively
- add error handling when video is private or deleted (pytube throws an exception : `pytube.exceptions.VideoUnavailable`)
- add functionality to save progress video by video in Notion and thus continuing after last video downloaded
- add bitrate and video format in debugger at each vid and, if necesary, and handling for video that don't have : `mime_type='video/mp4'` and `res='720p'`
- fix error that makes playlist grabber get one less that actual number
- make video download async and run by 3 or 4 vids

### Abandoned | Not useful anymore
- find a BETTER WAY to check if download has really started —> get filename by deduction : check which file popped the most recently !
- after downloading supposed to be finished, check if number files downloaded == len(vids_urls)
- add something in Notion collection description that shows this has been generated by this program (abandoned : useless)
- add video N° in Notion (impossible for some videos that don't contain their index in title)
- make sure videos urls are FIRST saved in Notion (if not already) and then downloaded one by one, urls read directly from Notion and not from `vids_urls` array (irrelevant because downloader finds row corresponding to queried video url)
- make window auto close (impossible)
- add a way to check download has really STARTED —> if a file named video_filename + ".part" is present in the same time as video_filename (indirectly done)
