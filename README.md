### How may I help you, lazy developer ?
1) Go to the main videos page in channel you provided.
2) Get all videos' URLs. Of course, scrolling down until the playlist's end is included.
3) Write all the videos' data to the Notion page URL provided.
4) Inspect all playlists and record in which playlist(s) each video in main videos page appears.
5) 

### Dependancies
- selenium webdriver
- pytube

### Quick fices for common issues
- If `pytube` gets you a `SSL Certificate` error, and you're on macOS, launch `Install Certificates.command` in `Applications/Python3.x/`

### TO-DO
[✓] recode the handler looper by calling itself recursively
[-] inspect all playlists and record matches in existing Notion rows
[-] force English with Selenium but only for channels spoken in English
[✓] fix problem with dates somewhere (july truncated in jui like juin)
[✓] add error handling when video is private or deleted (pytube throws an exception : `pytube.exceptions.VideoUnavailable`)
[x] add something in Notion collection description that shows this has been generated by this program (abandoned : useless)
[x] add video N° in Notion (impossible for some videos that don't contain their index in title)
[✓] add functionality to save progress video by video in Notion and thus continuing after last video downloaded
[x] make sure videos urls are FIRST saved in Notion (if not already) and then downloaded one by one, urls read directly from Notion and not from `vids_urls` array (irrelevant because downloader finds row corresponding to queried video url)
[✓] add bitrate and video format in debugger at each vid and, if necesary, and handling for video that don't have : `mime_type='video/mp4'` and `res='720p'`
[✓] fix error that makes playlist grabber get one less that actual number
[✓] make video download async and run by 3 or 4 vids
[x] make window auto close (impossible)
[✓] find a BETTER WAY to check if download has really started —> get filename by deduction : check which file popped the most recently !
[x] add a way to check download has really STARTED —> if a file named video_filename + ".part" is present in the same time as video_filename (indirectly done)
[✓] after downloading supposed to be finished, check if number files downloaded == len(vids_urls)
